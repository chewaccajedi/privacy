Anonymous Email and Encryption
------------------------------

With Tail and the Tor network we are able to safely navigate the Internet (and even the 'Deep Web' or 'Dark Net',
but we cannot do much, because as soon as we identify ourselves with any service (Google, Yahoo or even any forum
where you may be registered), you would have instantly revealed your identity and everything you do from that
point will still be logged and profiled.

The next step is to forge one or multiple alternative identities that you would use to interact with portals and
other people in the Internet, without ever revealing who you really are or where you actually are.

The cornerstone of these identities is to have an 'anonymous email', an email account which is not tied up to your
name, your ID, your telephone number nor another of your email addresses. A totally new and clean email address
with no strings attached.

This is not that simple, because Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail and any major email provider will ask you at least for a
verified telephone number, and if you are in a place where 'burner phones' are not available you will have no way
to fullfil with this requirement.

Fortunately, there are still a few services that can provide you with 'anonymous email', we have successfully
tested:

http://en.onionmail.info/ (this is the clearne explanatory website, to set up an account you will need to
                           connect to any of their .onion servers)

You must use your Tails session to create these accounts and every time you use them. You must never access these
accounts using 'normal' software as you will be instantly compromising your privacy.

Once equiped with anonymous email, you can create accounts in forums or communicate with people without revealing
your actual name or location. Now you truly are anonymous in the Internet.
