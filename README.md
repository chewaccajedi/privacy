Notes and links about how to be private in the Internet
-------------------------------------------------------
The internet has become a very dangerous place, plagued
with crime, abuse, fake news, deception and many more.

However, the very same internet could be our best tool
to combat and prevent all the above when well used.

This project is our recollection of tools and notes about
why and how to stay private (anonymous) in the internet.

Our intention is to make easier to the average user to navigate
the many options that work (or don't) to preserve your
privace in the internet.

There are many valid reasons to stay private in the internet,
from activists under the survellance of an abusive regime
to anyone just trying to avoid being profiled by marketing and tech
giants for commercial and political purposes by exploiting the
data traces we leave behind when we use the internent in
the 'normal' way.

While staying private may not be legal in certain jurisdictions,
we believe that privacy is a fundamental right of each and
every person, so we are just trying to shortening the learning
curve of ourselves and any other who may need to staty private
for legitimate ethical purposes.

We chose GitHub as our tool because it allows contribution via
Tor, which is a key tool to stay private in the internet.

You may browse the notes in GitHub or clone the whole
repository to your PC.

If you wish to contribute with this project, kindly contact
the administration, but be prepared to act in complete
anonymity. You will never meet, see, speak or know the name
of any of us, and we won't expect to know yours.
